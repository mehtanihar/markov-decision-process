1. Algorithm

The planner uses policy iteration algorithm.
It consists of two functions evaluate_policy and policy_improve.
The evaluate_policy function tries to evaluate the value functions V
for a given policy.It considers sum over all other states s' for a given state s and a given policy for the states and stores it in the value function.
The policy_improve function tries to find the policy that maximises the above sum. If the new policy is different from the previous one,
the new policy is an improved one. Now, we go back to evaluate_policy function and then again back to policy_improve function till we reach convergence.

The policy iteration algorithm coverges much faster than value iteration algorithm. Hence I have used the former one.


2. Libraries
It uses fstream library for input-output.
It also uses list library for a data structure list of 2D multiarrays
which corresponds to the list of rewards or probabilities to states s' for each value of State s and action a.
